<div class="container">
    <div class="block1"> First of all, individual element boxes are laid out by taking the elements' content,
        then adding any padding, border and margin around them — it's that box model thing again,
        which we've looked at earlier.</div>

    <div class="block2"> By default, a block level element's content is 100% of the width of its parent element, and
        as tall as its content. Inline elements are as tall as their content, and as wide as their
        content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content
        of block level elements. If you want to control the size of an inline element in this manner,
        you need to set it to behave like a block level element with display: block; (or even,display:
        inline-block; which mixes characteristics from both.)</div>

    <div class="block3"> That explains individual elements, but what about how elements interact with one another? The
        normal layout flow (mentioned in the layout introduction article) is the system by which elements
        are placed inside the browser's viewport. By default, block-level elements are laid out in the
        block flow direction, based on the parent's writing mode (initial: horizontal-tb) — each one will
        appear on a new line below the last one, and they will be separated by any margin that is set on
        them. In English therefore, or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode, block-level elements
        are laid out vertically.</div>
