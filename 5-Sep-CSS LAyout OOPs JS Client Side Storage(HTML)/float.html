<p id="special">The float property was introduced to allow web developers to implement simple layouts involving
    an image floating inside a column of text, with the text wrapping around the left or right of
    it.</p> <p align="justify">The kind of thing you might get in a newspaper layout.
    But web developers quickly realized that you can float anything, not just images, so the use of
    float broadened, for example to fun layout effects such as drop-caps.
    Floats have commonly been used to create entire web site layouts featuring multiple columns of
    information floated so they sit alongside one another (the default behavior would be for the columns
    to sit below one another, in the same order as they appear in the source). There are newer, better layout
    techniques available and so use of floats in this way should be regarded as a legacy technique.
